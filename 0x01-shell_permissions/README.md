This project focuses on understanding and managing file permissions in Linux, a key component of system security. Learners will explore the basics of file ownership, user roles, and permission settings, including changing permissions for files and directories. Through hands-on tasks, students will practice setting, modifying, and verifying permissions, ensuring they are well-versed in controlling access to files and directories within the Linux command line.
